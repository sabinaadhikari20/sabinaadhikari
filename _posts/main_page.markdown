Welcome to the page of Sabina Adhikari. I have shared my work history that I did during my undergraduate and graduate years. My specialization is in Data Science and Analytics. I have a background in data analysis, research work, and teaching. My programming skills are in Python, R, React, Ruby on Rails, HTML, and CSS. I am still learning and will always be student in heart.
